# Python-File-reader
A simple python script that allows you to read files 

If you currently don't know how to make a .py into a exe file, I recommend you watch this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqNvkAfTvIc&t=28s

If you do not want to do that, download it from the tags


important:
The exe file may not work because your windows defender giving no accces to the exe file because it is unverifyed;
If this happens to you, you may want to use command prompt and run it that way.

instructions to run in command prompt:

open command prompt where that file is located and type 'python {file name}'
 The '{file name]' is a placeholder, replace it with the real name of the file
